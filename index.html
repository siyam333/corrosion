        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Insulation Failure</h3>
        <p>
          Standard fibreglass insulation does not offer an effective moisture
          barrier for cold water pipes, contrary to manufacturer claims.
          Condensed region humidity causes a secondary corrosion state on the
          pipe's exterior, which is usually unseen. External corrosion losses,
          which are most common in cool water and dual temperature systems, can
          be 10 times or more than interior corrosion rates. as the pipe is
          corroded in the position between 5 and 7'O clock we can say this an
          insulation failure as the humidity in that region is more.
        </p>
        <h3>Under Deposit Corrosion</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most harmful types of corrosion to a piping system is under
          deposit corrosion. It's commonly referred to as "cell corrosion" since
          it's aggressive and localised, causing deep penetration of the metal
          surface while generating less general corrosion in the surrounding
          areas. All corrosion forces attack a small number of individual sites
          due to surface deposits, electrical imbalance, or some other beginning
          mechanism.

          <h2>Types of Corrosion</h2>
          <p>
            The main reason for the failure of the boiler water wall tube is due
            to overheating. The pressure is so high as the temperature is so
            high. chemicals incorrected mounts high temperature makes the oxygen
            to attack the metal shut down and leaving it.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The standards of water quality of the boiler water-wall tube
                should be implemented strictly in the operation process, in
                order to improve the operating environment of the boiler tube,
                especially to control the oxygen content in the water
              </li>
              <li>
                Preventing the boiler tube from exceeding the working
                temperature and working pressure can also slow down the
                oxidation corrosion
              </li>
              <li>
                Regular cleaning and wall thickness inspection of boiler tubes
                are also extremely important.
