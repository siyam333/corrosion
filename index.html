        <h2>Insulation Failure</h2>
        <p>Standard fibreglass insulation does not offer an effective moisture barrier for cold water pipes, contrary to manufacturer claims. Condensed region humidity causes a secondary corrosion state on the pipe's exterior, which is usually unseen. External corrosion losses, which are most common in cool water and dual temperature systems, can be 10 times or more than interior corrosion rates.
            as the pipe is corroded in the position between 5 and 7'O clock we can say this an insulation failure as the humidity in that region is more. 
        </p>
        <h2>Under Deposit Corrosion</h2>
        <p>One of the most harmful types of corrosion to a piping system is under deposit corrosion. It's commonly referred to as "cell corrosion" since it's aggressive and localised, causing deep penetration of the metal surface while generating less general corrosion in the surrounding areas. All corrosion forces attack a small number of individual sites due to surface deposits, electrical imbalance, or some other beginning mechanism.
