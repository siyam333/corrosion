        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Insulation Failure</h3>
        <p>
          Standard fibreglass insulation does not offer an effective moisture
          barrier for cold water pipes, contrary to manufacturer claims.
          Condensed region humidity causes a secondary corrosion state on the
          pipe's exterior, which is usually unseen. External corrosion losses,
          which are most common in cool water and dual temperature systems, can
          be 10 times or more than interior corrosion rates. as the pipe is
          corroded in the position between 5 and 7'O clock we can say this an
          insulation failure as the humidity in that region is more.
        </p>
        <h3>Under Deposit Corrosion</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most harmful types of corrosion to a piping system is under
          deposit corrosion. It's commonly referred to as "cell corrosion" since
          it's aggressive and localised, causing deep penetration of the metal
          surface while generating less general corrosion in the surrounding
          areas. All corrosion forces attack a small number of individual sites
          due to surface deposits, electrical imbalance, or some other beginning
          mechanism.
